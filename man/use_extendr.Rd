If \code{NULL}, sanitized R package name is used instead.}

\item{quiet}{Logical indicating whether any progress messages should be
generated or not.}

\description{
Create the scaffolding needed to add Rust extendr code to an R package. \code{use_extendr()}
adds a small Rust library with a single Rust function that returns the string
\code{"Hello world!"}. It also adds wrapper code so this Rust function can be called from
R with \code{hello_world()}.
}
\details{
This function can be called on an existing package including rextendr templates;
you will be asked if either the \code{src} directory or the \code{R/extendr-wrappers.R} file
are existing. And, even if you select to overwrite them, \code{Cargo.toml}, \code{lib.rs}
and \code{extendr-wrappers.R} will not be overwritten.
