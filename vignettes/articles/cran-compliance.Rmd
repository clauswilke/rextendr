In order for Rust-based packages to exist on CRAN, there are a number of
fairly stringent requirements that must be adhered to. CRAN published [Using Rust in CRAN packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/using_rust.html) in mid-2023, outlining their requirements for building and hosting Rust-based packages. 

This article describes CRAN requirements as of the day of writing and illustrates how `{rextendr}` can be used to adhere to them. 

## `SystemRequirements`

Building Rust-backed packages from source requires the system dependencies `cargo` and `rustc`. CRAN has stipulated their preferred way of tracking this is using the following line in a packages `DESCRIPTION` file.

```
SystemRequirements: Cargo (Rust's package manager), rustc
```
Even though this is a free-form field, having consistency can help the whole ecosystem keep track of Rust-based R packages. 

## `cargo` and `rustc` availability

In order for an R package to be built from source, `cargo` and `rustc` need to be available to the machine compiling the package. The expectation for R packages using external dependencies is to have a `configure` and `configure.win` files that check if the dependencies are available before attempting to compile the package. If the checks fail, the build process will be stopped prematurely. 

CRAN expects that if `cargo` is not on the `PATH`, the user's home directory is checked at `~/.cargo/bin`. The configuration files must perform these checks. 

## `cargo build` settings 

CRAN also imposes restrictions on how `cargo` builds crates. CRAN has requested that no more than two logical CPUs be used in the build process. By default, `cargo` uses multiple threads to speed up the compilation process. CRAN policy allows for a maximum of two. This is set using the `-j 2` option, which is passed to `cargo build`. 

Additionally, to minimize security risks and ensure package stability, CRAN requires that packages be built completely offline. This prevents external dependencies from being downloaded at compile time. Because of this requirement, vendored dependencies must be used.

## Vendored dependencies 

Vendoring dependencies is the act of including the dependency itself in a package source code. In the case of Rust, dependencies are fetched only at compile time. To enable compilation in an offline environment, dependencies must be vendored, which is accomplished using the `cargo vendor` command. 

`cargo vendor` creates a local directory with the default name `vendor`, which contains the source code for each of the recursive dependencies of the crate that is being built. For CRAN compatibility, the `vendor` directory must be compressed using tar xz compression and included in the source of the package. 

During the build time, the dependencies are extracted, compiled, and then discarded. This process is controlled by the `Makevars` and `Makevars.win` files. 

## Package compilation

All of this comes together during package compilation time, providing all of the following requirements are met: 

- cargo must be able to be called from a user's home directory
- the user's home directory must not be modified or written to 
- the package must be compiled offline 
- no more than two logical CPUs are used
- the versions of `cargo` and `rustc` are printed


## Using CRAN defaults

rextendr provides default CRAN compliant scaffolding via the `use_cran_defaults()` function and appropriate vendoring with `vendor_pkgs()`.

### Making a package CRAN compliant

To create a CRAN compliant R package begin by creating a new R package. Do so by calling `usethis::create_package()`. In the new R project, run `rextendr::use_extendr()` to create the minimal scaffolding necessary for a Rust-powered R package. Once you have done this, you can now run `rextendr::use_cran_defaults()`. 

`use_cran_defaults()` will create the `configure` and `configure.win` files. Additionally, it will create new `Makevars` and `Makevars.win` that print the versions of `cargo` and `rustc` as well as use the `cargo build` argument `-j 2 --offline`.

### Vendoring packages 

After having configured your R package to use CRAN defaults, you will need to vendor your dependencies.

`vendor_pkgs()` runs `cargo vendor` on your behalf, compresses the `vendor/` directory, and updates the `vendor-config.toml` file accordingly. 

When you have added new dependencies, changed the version or source of the crates, you should use `vendor_pkgs()` again. Doing so ensures that the compressed `vendor.tar.xz` contains the updates too. This is very important for CI and publishing to CRAN.
